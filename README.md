# Stranger Lights

Display Twitter messages on a string of Christmas lights (inspired by that one Stranger Things scene)

![demo](./demo.gif)

# Hardware

- [HiLetGo ESP8266](https://smile.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Internet-Development-Wireless-Micropython/dp/B010O1G1ES)
- A strand/sequence of (at least) 26 WS2812 LEDs (search for "addressable Christmas lights", make certain they are WS2812 compatible)
- Wallpaper and black paint

# Setup

Hang a strand of addressable LEDs, starting at the letter Z snaking up through I to Q, then up to H through A.
Assuming a strand of exactly 26 pixels, see the [Pixel Map](./PIXELMAP.md) for which pixel index corresponds to which letter.

### `firmware/secrets.h`

Create the following file with your secret WiFi credentials and Twitter handle:

```c
const char *SSID = "ithurtswhenip";
const char *PASSWORD = "hunter";
String PATH = "TwitterNameHere";
```

### Firmware

In [firmware/firmware.ino](./firmware/firmware.ino), set `*SSID` `*PASSWORD` to the SSID and password of your WiFi network.

If your light strand doesn't correspond exactly to each letter, e.g. you have a strand of 50 lights with some being unused between each letter, set `PRECISE` to `false` and change the values in the method `lightPreciseLetter` to match your lights' positions.

### Twitter API

Deploy this application to Heroku, or feel free to use `strtw.herokuapp.com`. I'll keep it freely available as long as the rate limit doesn't get hit.

# Troubleshooting

- _Lights stopping after a period of time (20-40min)_: This could be due to [a memory leak in 2.4.x](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/issues/4497). Try installing [ESP8266](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) version **2.3.0** within the Board Manager.
